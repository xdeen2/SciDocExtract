# SciDocExtract

SciDocExtract is an AI/ML-driven system designed to identify, extract, and process elements from scanned technical and scientific documents. The system focuses on tables, plots, photos, and other document elements, delivering structured, machine-readable outputs. SciDocExtract is designed to be system-agnostic, containerized, and compliant with DoD and NIST guidelines.
# Key Features:
## 1.	Document Ingestion:
Supported Formats: Ingest documents in common formats such as PDF.
Artifact Handling: Process documents with readability-degrading artifacts.
## 2.	Element Identification and Extraction:
Tables: Identify and extract entire tables, including titles, captions, headers, and entries. Output in structured format and markup language.
Plots: Identify and extract plots, including titles, captions, axes, keys, and data. Additional processing for different plot types (histograms, scatter plots, single/multiple curves).
Other Elements: Capability to extend to other document elements as required.
## 3.	Data Processing:
Tables: Extract table components and provide structured output in JSON, XML, or Markdown.
Plots: Extract plot components, process for accurate recreation, and provide structured output in JSON, XML, or Markdown.
Additional Processing: Handle specialized processing for different plot types to allow accurate recreation.
## 4.	Output Formats:
Machine-Readable: Provide outputs in JSON, XML, Markdown, etc.
Markup Language: Use appropriate markup languages for detailed recreation.
## 5.	System Design:
Modular Architecture: Ensure modular design for easy integration and customization.
Pipeline Agnostic: Design to be system and pipeline agnostic.
Interoperability: Compatible with other software written in modern languages like Python.
Local Computation: All computations are performed locally with no off-premises resources.
## 6.	Stability and Documentation:
Sustained Use: Stable for long-term use and processing of many documents.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for design, implementation, and usage, accessible to software engineers and data scientists.
## 7.	Independence and Compliance:
Independent Operation: Operable and fine-tunable without ongoing vendor relationship.
Compliance: Adhere to DoD and NIST guidelines for hardening and security.
Inspection Ready: Model training, validation, and testing data available for government inspection.
# Technical Architecture:
## 1.	Frontend:
User Interface: Developed using modern web technologies (React, Angular) for a user-friendly interface.
Visualization: Interface for uploading documents, viewing extracted elements, and exporting data.
## 2.	Backend:
Microservices Architecture: Scalable and resilient backend using microservices.
Data Processing Engine: Real-time processing and normalization of document data.
APIs: RESTful APIs for integration with other tools and data sources.
Database: Secure database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing structured outputs and logs.
## 3.	Security:
Encryption: End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Access Control: Implement RBAC and MFA for secure access.
Logging and Monitoring: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for security and performance.
# Implementation Steps:
## 1.	Requirements Definition:
Collaborate with stakeholders to define detailed requirements and use cases.
## 2.	Design and Prototyping:
Design the system architecture, data flow, and integration points.
Create prototypes for key components.
## 3.	Development:
Implement frontend and backend components.
Develop data collection agents and APIs for data ingestion.
Implement security controls and compliance checks.
## 4.	Testing:
Conduct unit, integration, and system testing to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Perform security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
## 5.	Deployment:
Deploy the system in a staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT).
Roll out to the production environment following successful UAT.
## 6.	Training and Documentation:
Provide training to military personnel on using the system.
Maintain comprehensive documentation for users, administrators, and developers.
# Continuous Improvement:
## 1.	Feedback Loop:
Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
## 2.	Updates and Upgrades:
Regularly update the system to add new features, improve performance, and address security issues.
## 3.	Documentation:
Maintain comprehensive documentation for users, administrators, and developers.
By implementing SciDocExtract, the military can achieve efficient, automated extraction and processing of scientific and technical document elements, enhancing their data analysis capabilities and ensuring compliance with stringent security standards.
